We created smart building technology to improve energy efficiency by using occupancy information for intelligent heating and cooling control. Heating and cooling account for 45% of all energy used in the average US home. Our work on heating and cooling control reduced residential energy usage by up to 28%, with as little as $25 in additional hardware.

	MacroLab allows a user to write a single macroprogram for an entire Cyber-Physical System. It is the first system that can perform automatic, topology-specific decomposition of programs describing parallel operations on parallel data structures.

      Wireless sensor networks for ecological research are often deployed in harsh environments where they must survive the elements of nature and function for extended periods of time with no further access for several months. Imagine a monitoring system deployed in polar regions where access is available only during certain months of the year. The system as a whole must function even when parts of it fail. The need for such a reliable, fault-tolerant system is the main motivation for the design of LUSTER--Light Under Shrub-Thicket for Environmental Research.
