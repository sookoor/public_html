I am currently a Computer Scientist in the Computational & Information Sciences Directorate at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. I earned my BE from Vanderbilt University and my MS and PhD from the University of Virginia. I have broad research interests in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), Wireless Embedded Networks (WENs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and ubiquitous computing. My PhD research focused on harnessing the potential of distributed systems to affect and interact with the physical world by easing the CPS application development process through high level programming and debugging abstractions, and utilizing CPSs to increase the energy efficiency of smart homes through occupancy-based control of heating and air conditioning systems. At ARL, I research computation offloading in tactical environments to enable High-Performance Computational resources to be efficiently utilized in challenged environments such as battlefields and disaster relief sites. My r&eacute;sum&eacute; is available <a href="docs/tamim_sookoor_resume.pdf" title="here">here</a>.
